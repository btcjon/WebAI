+implement the following "Long-Term Memory (Supabase Database): This will be a Supabase database that stores past conversations. Each record in the database will include a user ID, session ID, timestamp, user message, and AI response. This allows the retrieval of past interactions for a user or a particular session, which is useful for maintaining context across multiple sessions and providing a personalized user experience. The user can access historical data using the user_id and session_id. We will have functions to store and retrieve data from this database."
